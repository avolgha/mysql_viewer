# MySQL Viewer

This application tries to make database viewing and editing better.  
And although the name includes "MySQL", the application should be able to interact with other kinds of databases as well **in the future**.

## Quick Start

To start, you need to have [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) and the [yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your system.  
Then you have to install all required dependencies and build the app.

```bash
# install the dependencies
$ yarn

# build the application
$ yarn build

# start the application
$ yarn start
```

That's it!

## Support
